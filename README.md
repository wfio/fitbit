## fitbit API in R
Script for scraping personal Fitbit data from the Fitbit API (dev.fitbit.com). It's open source so use it as you want to. I copied [1] it from somewhere else and am modifying it for my own purposes so you should feel free to do that same.

The script is written in R and uses packages 'httr' and 'jsonlite' to access and munge through the responses.
